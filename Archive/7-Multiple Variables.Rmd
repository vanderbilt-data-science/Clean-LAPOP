# Structure
I am hoping to create a stacked bar graph with multiple variables. I am going to pick a single question and then also select sex or age we can look at responses by those demographics. 

I'm going to use columns uniq_id, sex, age,  question 1 response.

# Shaping data

```{r}
# arg_multi <- argentina_clean %>% 
#   filter(wave == 2016) %>% 
#   filter(question %in% c("Sexo", "Edad", "Seriedad del cambio climÃ¡tico")) %>% 
#   spread(key = question, value = answer_dimension)
```

```{r}
arg_multi <- argentina_16_factor %>% 
  select(pais_factor, idnum_factor, sex_factor, wave_factor, ocup4a_factor, q2_factor)

write_csv(arg_multi, "Argentina Stacked Bar.csv")
```
